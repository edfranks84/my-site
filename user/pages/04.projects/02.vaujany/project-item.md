intro_title: Apartments and Chalets in Vaujany Alpe D'Huez
intro_text: The Vaujany Ski Company previously had a non responsive, out of date website, that didn't really show what they were all about. So I designed them a new website that enabled them to present all the services they offer and stand out amongst their competitors.<br><br>The new site design meant they could show of each of their different chalets/apartements in more detail, allowing people to get a better idea about the quality of the accommodation and services that they offer.
