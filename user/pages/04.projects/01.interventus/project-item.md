intro_text: Interventus originally had a very simple template site that didn't look very interesting and didn't represent how the company wanted to be seen to potential clients<br><br>So I designed them a new site that was creative and individual, allowing them to showcase the company and what they can offer to clients. They could now stand out amongst their competitors rather than just being another template site.
