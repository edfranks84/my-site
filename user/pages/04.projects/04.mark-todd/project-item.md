intro_title: International Event Rider Sir Mark Todd
intro_text: Mark Todd is one of the greatest equestrian riders of all time and Mark Todd Eventing had a site that didn't work well on mobiles, felt old and out of date. They wanted the website to promote the Mark Todd brand and its associates. Also to gather more interest and support from a wider audience.<br><br>So I created a new, modern, responsive site that allows them to display their content in a cleaner, easier to navigate way, as well as align the brand to be more about Mark using his signature as the main brand element and removing the New Zealand fern that as previously so prominent throughout the site.
