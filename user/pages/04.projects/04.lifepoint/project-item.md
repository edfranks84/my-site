intro_title: Independent Health Insurance Specialists
intro_text: Lifepoint Health insurance previously had a very corporate site that catered for a wide range of insurance products, but wanted to change their offering to be more focused on just health insurance and have a more personal feel.<br><br>So I created them something that focused on the health insurance sector and was less corporate in style, but still felt professional and kept their previous colour scheme. In order to create someting that felt a bit more personal, I tried to use imagery that was a bit less corporate where possible and more about family and caring.
